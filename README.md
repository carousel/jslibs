What kind of license should I use for a bigger project ? 

<h2>jslibs</h2>
<h3>This is my bash script for fast downloading of most commonly used JS libraries on client side.</h3>

It contains curl links to:
 - jQuery latest
 - Backbone
 - Underscore

After downloading, place a script somewhere on your path /usr/bin;/bin...
Now you can reach it anywhere from your project folder, with one command.
Script will create three new JS files in your working directory.

NOTE:
This scripts assumes that you have curl installed.
