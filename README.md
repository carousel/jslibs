This is my bash script for fast downloading of most commonly used JS libraries on client side.

It contains curl links to:

 - jQuery latest
 - Backbone
 - Undersore

After downloading, place a script somewhere on your path /usr/bin;/bin...
Now you can reach it anywhere from your project folder, with one command.
Script will create three new JS files in your working directory.
